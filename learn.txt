I am Kuldeep Meena
Dev Club is a wonderful club that connects us to the future i.e. computers via programming and in broadsense by making us developers.
It is better than classroom teaching as people in dev club learn more through developing rather than attending classes which i feel is 
the best way to become a successful coder. I would be happy to be a part of this club
